I had jekyll working at one point. But I used a different repo when going back to it, this messed everything up and somehow the new repo was using the old jekyll
that was installed, and ended up being around 8000 files and I am unable to delete them or unlink them. So I ended up having 3-4 themes, none of which were working, but all got linked into my freshly made repository, i dont understand.
I gave it a good try but I was unable to get it working. I REALLY dislike jekyll.
